Welcome to my academic website! I am a PhD student in Biomedical Sciences at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/), Italy, working in the [BioComputinUP](https://biocomputingup.it/) lab under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Miguel Monzon & Prof. Silvio CE Tosatto.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)** and their conformational ensembles. I am particularly interested in:

- **Computational methods** for determining and characterizing protein conformational ensembles
- **Bioinformatics databases** for intrinsically disordered proteins ([PED](https://proteinensemble.org/) & [DisProt](https://disprot.org/))
- **Integration of experimental and computational approaches** to study protein disorder
- **Structure-based drug design** and molecular docking (earlier work)

## Current Work

I am currently working on developing unified frameworks for determining conformational ensembles of disordered proteins, integrating both experimental biophysical data and computational modeling approaches. My work contributes to major bioinformatics databases including:

- **[PED](https://pedb.org)** - Protein Ensemble Database for structural ensembles of IDPs
- **[DisProt](https://disprot.org)** - The gold standard database for intrinsically disordered proteins and regions


## Recent Highlights

- **2025**: Our review has been published in *Current Opinion in Structural Biology* on advances in disordered protein ensemble determination
- **2025**: Our study on defining the unified frameworks for conformational ensemble determination (Accepted in Nature Methods)



## Publications

I have published 10+ peer-reviewed articles in leading journals including *Nucleic Acids Research*, *Current Opinion in Structural Biology*, and *Computational Biology and Chemistry*. You can find all my publications in the [Publications](/publications/) section.
