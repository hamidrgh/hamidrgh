DisProt (URL: https://disprot.org) is the gold standard database for intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, providing valuable information about their functions. The latest version of DisProt brings significant advancements, including a broader representation of functions and an enhanced curation process. These improvements aim to increase both the quality of annotations and their coverage at the sequence level. Higher coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes. Quality of annotations has been improved by systematically applying Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) principles and reporting all the details of the experimental setup that could potentially influence the structural state of a protein. The DisProt database now includes new thematic datasets and has expanded the adoption of Gene Ontology terms, resulting in an extensive functional repertoire.
